        	<p>The most significant effect on the sound of any system is speaker placement and the interaction of the speakers sound with your room. Speaker placemnt is something you can control (mostly), whereas interactions like boundary gain, peaks, nulls, and room modes are something you can't really control, apart from accoustic treatment. However, there are ways to mitigate the imapct that the room will have on the quality of your sound system that do not require you to put foam all over your walls. Most recievers have built-in room correction software such as Audessey, Dirac, Anthem Room Correction, etc. and there are online versions such as Room EQ Wizard and others also.</p>

        	<p>These softwares measure the frequency response of each speaker in your room, and then help to smooth out the response of them individually so that the room is not effecting the sound you get as much. It will also adjust the volume if needed, and it will adjust the time delay on each  channel so that sounds hit your ears at the exact same time. </p>

        	<p>You can also make level and delay adjustments manually by using a decibel meter (can get an app on your phone) and changing the volume levels so they all match. You can also simply trust your ears - if one speaker sounds louder than another, turn it down! However, sometimes our ears can be deceiving, so if you can, use room correction software whaenever possible, especially in a home theater environment.</p>
