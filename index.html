    		<main>
        		<p>This website is all about how to build a home theater/media room! I have gathered information over the past few years about putting together a good sound system for both movies and music, and I would like to share what I know with others. I am by no means an expert, and am still learning new things about the hobby every day, but if I can share some information to help someone else or get people interested in it, I feel like I've acomplished something! Even if no one ever sees this (which I feel is likely) it is just fun for me to talk about this stuff. Most of the diagram photos I will be using come from <a href="https://www.dolby.com/about/support/guide/speaker-setup-guides/">Dolby<a/> and are the most effective diagrams I have found to vilualize room layouts.</p>
