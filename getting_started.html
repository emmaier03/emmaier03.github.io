    <main>
        	<p>To get started Building a home theater or multimedia space, first consider what your goal is. The main focus of this website will be creating a theater-like experience in your own home, but if you are more focused on a setup for listening to music, much of this advice will still apply. For two-channel stereo music, all you need is two speakers, but for home theater, you need more - five, seven, nine, and eleven are common numbers - because we want to create a surround sound effect. I would highly recommend purchasing equipment like speakers, subwoofers, and recievers used from something like Facebook Marketplace, Craiglist, or something similar. This way you will save a ton of money, and you are also being resourceful and helping reduce e-waste. </p>

        	<h3>Home Theater</h3>
        	<p>If you want to build a home theater, I recommend starting with a 5.1 setup. You will need an audio/video receiver, five speakers, a subwoofer, and speaker wire. With this setup, you will have three front speakers, two surround speakers, and one low frequency speaker. Below is an example of a simple 5.1 setup (the 5 standing for the number of "bedlayer" or ear level speakers, the 1 standing for the number of subwoofers or low frequency effects (LFE) channels.</p>

        	<p>The two main speakers in the front (the floorstanding or "tower" speakers) are known as your "front left" and "front right." Then in the middle is your "center" channel, and the speakers to the side and slightly behind the couch are your "surround left" and "surround right." The larger speaker on the floor is your subwoofer, also referred to as the "LFE" channel.</p>

    		<h3>2 Channel Stereo</h3>
    		<p>For a stereo music setup, you will need either a reciever (which is the easiest option), OR an integrated amplifier with something like bluetooth or WiFi built in, OR a digital to analog converter (DAC) and an amplifier, plus two speakers (and speaker wire). </p>
