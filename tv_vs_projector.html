    	<h1>Should You Get a TV or a Projector?</h1>
    
    <main>
        	<p>The next thing you need to do is decide if your home theater or multimedia room is going to have a TV or a projector. There are pros and cons to each that may help you make a desicion. In most multimedia spaces, a TV is going to be more practical, wheras in a dedicated theater room, you may want to go with a projector. If you are building a stereo system, you may not want or need a TV at all, however it is nice to also be able to watch content with a 2.0 or 2.1 system.</p>

        	<h3>TV</h3>
        	<p>There are several reasons you may want to chose a TV over a projector, and for most people, it will likely be the more practical choice.</p>

        	<p><b>Pros of TV:</b> A TV is a much more budget friendly option than a high quality projector. TVs come in a wide variety of styles and size options, so there is one that will fit everyones needs. They are also easier to install, and they are a lot more flexible in terms of placement. Nicer TVs also have a higher picture quality than even most high end projectors, and the black levels on something like an OLED are far better than what a projector can provide. </p>

    		<h3>Projector</h3>
    		<p>If you want to get serious about home theater, you will most likely want to eventually upgrade to a laser projector. This option is more for the enthusiast who wants to go all out building a room that will give a cinema-like experience. </p>

    		<p><b>Pros of Projector:</b> A projector will give you the opportunity to have the largest screen size and picture possible. They will provide the most immersive exeperience and the most theater-equivalent images. They also allow you to place your speakers behind an accoustically transparent screen so that all the action happening on screen is actually coming from the screen insted of from behind or below it. They are also very high quality if you invest in a good laser projector.</p>

    	<article class="mart2">
    		<p><b>Cons of a TV:</b> TVs do not give as immersive of an experience as a projector, simply because the largest widely available sizes for TVs are around 100 inches, while projectors can get a size of 200 inches or more. TVs also require you to place your speakers underneath and to the sides, so the sounds are not coming directly from the screen (although with a smaller display, this is actually a good thing because you want the sense of spaciousness and large soundstage that you get from spreading your speakers apart).

    	<article class="mart2">
    		<p><b>Cons of a projector:</b> High quality projectors are very expensive, so they are not easily accessible to the average person. They also require more installation if it is an overhead unit. They are also a lot less flexible than a TV and require you to have a large, empty wall to put a screen onto. They also do not have quite as good picture quality as a higher end TV.
